## Description

We're going to be hacking model cars to be controlled by low-power hardware.

To start out, Ben has an RC Lamborghini which he has hacked to be controllable
by a Raspberry Pi. He also has a coprocessor for his Raspberry Pi called a
Movidius Neural Compute Stick. It seems to offer 1-2 orders of magnitude
performance improvement for many neural net and computer vision applications
over plain RasPi CPU.

The first step of the project is to write the robotics software for controlling
the car's motors and creating a data-processing pipeline. Ben can spearhead
this effort, but other contributions are very welcome.

The second step is to brainstorm ideas for objectives of the model car (e.g.
following a person, mapping a room, etc). Normal cars need to stay on the road,
avoid pedestrians, obey traffic laws, etc. What should our model cars do? Note
that there doesn't need to be one answer to this question: once we create the
infrastructure for controlling model RC cars, we can try a bunch of different
approaches! You can do your own, too!

The third step is to collect data and train our models for controlling the car.
This might involve very different approaches depending on on the objective
we've defined!

The zero-th step is to build your own car! We can use Ben's model car for
testing, but the code should work on any model car. Why not build your own
and bring it to the group? The group can give you some pointers too!

## Group meetup schedule
