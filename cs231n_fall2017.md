## Description

We are covering the material on the Stanford CS231 course together as study group. 

We will meet to discuss the lectures and to work on the assignments. There are 
three assignments and a larger project. We'll decide later if we take on a project. 
Obviously, the purpose of this group is to get us all up to speed in order to join
other groups within the Meetup on more advanced projects.
